Documentation
  New Pod for Tk::MsgBox.

  Created a CAVEATS section in Tk::Image for the FAQ about memory
  leaks and images.

  Added missing L<...> links.

  Some minor Pod fixes.

Tests
  Make sure that tests won't be run if no X11 is running to prevent
  unnecessary cpantesters reports.

  New test for Text widget (t/text.t)

  New test for scripts (t/exefiles.t)

  New test for Tk::Adjuster (t/adjuster.t)

  More Tk::FBox tests (e.g. chooseDirectory ...)

Tk-804.027-p4.patch.gz (2006-11-26)
----------------------

Compiles and passes tests on

  FreeBSD 6.1 + perl5.8.8 + fontconfig 2.3.2
  FreeBSD 6.1 + bleadperl + fontconfig 2.3.2
  Linux Debian + perl5.8.8 + fontconfig 2.4.1
  Solaris 8 + gcc-4.0.3 + perl-5.8.8 + fontconfig-2.4.1 (with two test
    errors in font.t)

I also had success with compiling under recent cygwin using the x11
libraries a few days earlier.

Fixes
  XFT works now with recent fontconfig, no core dumps anymore.

  Fix for segfault in t/regexp.t with perl 5.9.x. See also
  http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-02/msg00748.html
  for a similar issue.

  Workaround for core dumps when using -font=>undef.

  Fixed wrong usage of $#{@...} which does not work anymore in
  bleadperl.

  Fixed Tk::Text movements wordstart and wordend in unicode content.

  Better handling of undef in BrowseEntry widgets. Bug reported by
  Puetz Kevin A.

  A couple of compilation warning fixes.

Tests
  Continued text.t conversion.

  More tests in font.t.

  Fixed failing tests if no windows manager (under X11) is running.

  Fixed some false test failures in listbox.t (font detection was
  wrong).

  Disabled fork.t and fileevent.t on cygwin (same like MSWin32).

Tk-804.027-p3.patch.gz (2006-11-20)
----------------------

Compiles and passes tests on

  FreeBSD 6.1 + perl5.8.8 + xorg 6.9.x + various window managers (fvwm2, twm, metacity ...)
  Linux RedHat 8.0 + perl5.8.0 (one test failure in leak.t)
  Linux RedHat 8.0 + perl5.8.7
  MSWin32 + Strawberry Perl (5.8.8)

There are some test failures with bleedperl, most of them
Tie::Watch-related, which will be fixed in a next version of the
patch.

Incompatible changes
  Return values of some Tk::Wm methods (e.g. aspect, wmGrid,
  iconposition, resizable ...) were changed from returning tclish
  lists (e.g. "1 2 3 4") to perlish lists (1,2,3,4). I believe the
  return values of these methods are rarely used.

  Tk::Wm::wmTracing needs argument for setting on/off, without
  argument just return the current value.

New features
  The newest tkUnixWm.c from Tcl/Tk is now in the Perl/Tk code. This
  adds (experimental?) support for wm attributes -topmost, -zoomed,
  -fullscreen and other _NET_WM features (iconphoto) under Unix/X11.

  Tk::Wm::stackorder was missing in Perl/Tk.

  widget demonstration has a Ctrl-Q key binding.

  ptksh: x is an alias for d (like in the perl debugger).
  ptksh: use bold font for prompt.

  Tk::Text: pasting selection with middle mouse sets cursor position now.
  This is consistent with behaviour in other toolkits.

  Tk::Widget: translated UnderlineAmpersand etc. functions.

  Tk::MsgBox: again in Tk, completely new translation from the Tcl/Tk
  original. Looks nicer and behaves better than messageBox through
  Tk::DialogBox.

Fixes
  Fixed crashes of Perl/Tk applications when Gtk/Gnome applications
  were started. See http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=16053

  ptksh is not slow anymore when popping up history.
  ptksh: use fixed font for text area.

  Tk::FBox may handle paths with high-bit set.

  Image and bitmap filenames with high-bit set work now. See
  http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.perl.tk/msg/865b56226af23f7c

  Minor Tk::TextList fixes, but still most tests fail.

  Fixed some menu problems, see
  http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=15677,
  http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=6166

  Title of tearoff menus now set correctly.

  ptked may be started without initial filename.

  gedi works again.
  
  Fixed some core dumps.

  Tk::Listbox insert/delete does not leak memory anymore (well, not
  that much). See
  http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=12466

  Building on RedHat systems works now, see
  http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=6708

  Tk::NoteBook fix for pages method, see
  http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=8567

  Tk::Canvas fix for -state => hidden issue, see
  http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=4677

Documentation
  Tk::Widget::Walk is now documented.

  Corrected installation path for Tk::Menu::Item.

  Fixed invalid Pod syntax.

Tests
  Converted some tests from Test to Test::More

  Enable unicode tests where possible.

  Make all tests working with XFT=1.

  New tests, converted from the Tcl counterparts: canvas.t, wm-tcl.t,
  text.t (latter not completed yet)

  00wmcheck.t: show user's window manager before starting tests.

  (Almost) no test should request user positioning windows (for old
  window managers like twm).

  Some wm-dependent tests were marked as TODO tests.

release is at the top.

complete, but short on detail.
