OSF's 'make' has problems with the constructed Makefiles.

make
just says:
`Makefile' is up to date.

Using GNU make solves this. 

Otherwise type:

make all

and do 'install' by hand:

make all

perl ./basic_demo 

cp -r blib /usr/local/lib/perl5

Note that the cp -r does *not* do quite the same as a make install,
in particular the binaries are not separated from the scripts.
