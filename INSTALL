Unpack the tar file *outside* the perl source tree for preference.

To install this package you need perl5.002beta1 and unoffical patches to 'f'.

Best place to get perl5.002b1f is via 'CPAN' site nearest you - the CPAN
sitelist at time of writing is appended.

ftp any-CPAN-site - see below:
cd CPAN/authors/id/ANDYD
bin
get perl5.002b1d.tar.gz
get perl5.002beta1.patch.2b1e.gz
get perl5.002beta1.patch.2b1f.gz

When patch.2.b1g shows up it should be safe to apply as well, as 
Andy plans to make it a documentation patch.

Latest MakeMaker from CPAN may help too.

See README.osname for further hints/warnings

If you have perl5.002b1f installed in the normal way you proceed to build Tk.

It is much simpler to install perl than to try and use an uninstalled
private copy. If you have a private copy you should 'Configure' it to 
'install' somewhere you have write access to, and install it there,
then use that perl to build Tk.

When you have an up-to-date perl5.002 installed:

cd to the directory distribution unpacks to.

Then if you have dynamic linking :

perl Makefile.PL
make 
# Now built locally - if you have dynamic loading you can now say
perl ./basic_demo 

make install

You can now run the converted Tk4.0 demos:

./demos/widget


---------------------------------------------------------

For static linking the following is how it is supposed to work 
(I think, but I don't use static linking normally, this scheme 
 worked as far as this on one trial under SunOS4.)

perl Makefile.PL
make 
make tkperl 

This builds a perl with Tk statically linked in the Tk directory
thus:

./tkperl ./basic_demo 

should now work.

It is unclear to me whether 'make install' works and I don't want 
to try it on my system incase is breaks the dynamic version.


If Makefile.PL reports that it cannot find X, or chooses a version
you don't like you can specify a version on the command line:

perl Makefile.PL X11=/usr/local/X11R5  

If X's include and lib are not under a common parent they can be specified
separately:

perl Makefile.PL X11INC=/usr/local/share/X11R5/include X11LIB=/usr/local/arch/X11R5/lib

Welcome to the CPAN, the Comprehensive Perl Archive Network.

The master CPAN site is at ftp://ftp.funet.fi/
(Finland, Europe).

The list of the registered CPAN sites follows.
Please note that the sorting order is alphabetical on fields:


	continent - country/state - ftp-url


and thus the North American servers happen to be listed last (for the
moment, anyway, no Oceanian or South American sites volunteered, yet).

We apologise for the diversity of the CPAN path names but
having identical and hopefully as short as possible path names
across several separate ftp sites is well nigh impossible.
