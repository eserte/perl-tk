Tk::Tree has a dual live on CPAN. Incorporate the 4.3 version.

Port more Tcl/Tk tests to Perl/Tk (text.test etc.)

messageBox fixes: <Return> does not use the currently selected button,
but always the default button, which seems not untuitive. Also, the
Tcl/Tk counterpart has nicer colored bitmaps, port them to Perl/Tk.

Check all Tk-related bugs on rt.cpan.org (some are already fixed).

Tk::FBox should deal with 8bit characters in filenames (i.e. use byte
semantics in filesystem operations, maybe use system encoding when
displaying filenames, but with graceful degradation).

What about getOpen/SaveFile and Windows, are there also encoding
issues with filenames?

Minimize diffs to original Tcl/Tk sources to make merging easier.

Integrate libpng 1.2.12 (or newer?)

Introduce msgcat support like in Tcl/Tk?

Simple tests for EXE_FILES (at least checking with perl -c, maybe also
starting and immediately destroying)

$mw->fontActual(undef) dumps core (both Windows and X11)

Non-Sun Drag&Drop (e.g. linux) (Win32 Site now at least partly working.)

Stipple bug, see Message-ID: <2uwCb.683348$pl3.76050@pd7tw3no> (should
be fixed with Tk 8.4.5).

One can't use filenames with high-bit characters in the Photo constructor:
	$photo = $mw->Photo(-file => "high-bit-chars");

Add 'as_default_dir' support for chooseDirectory (similar to
'as_default' for get(Open|Save)File). Documentation missing.

Widget review (Listbox.pm and Canvas.pm done)

Pod review (Listbox.pod done, options.pod and Canvas.pod in the works,
others pending)

Port all of Tcl/Tk test suite to Perl/Tk. t/listbox.t and t/entry.t
was a beginning.

Port message catalogs from Tcl/Tk to Perl/Tk.

Write a new Tk/804delta.pod.

Build and test with older perl releases.
